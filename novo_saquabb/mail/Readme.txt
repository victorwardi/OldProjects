I am dayfox, the main writer of Mailist 0.9
I think the internet should be simple for beginers, and that is why i have written this script.

Installing Mailist is incredibly easy, just copy the files (exactly as they are) . There is no need for a MySQL database, as the whole system runs on .txt flat files. An important note is that you cant change the places of the files, because they are all in relation to each other; in a chain. Make sure that the file mailist.txt is Chmodded correctly (666) the top 2 boxes ticked in all three lines. I

There arnt that many requirements, except for a PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) reading server (such as t35. check it out http://t35.com .  If you are running this script from home, you will need a server, such as apache, with PHP enabled.
