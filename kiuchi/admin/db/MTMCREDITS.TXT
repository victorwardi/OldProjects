==============================================================================

Morten's JavaScript Tree Menu was originally a slightly modified version
of Mike Hall's JavaScript Tree Menu as found on his web site in October, 1998.
Development of his version has since discontinued, but his web site remains
online at http://www.brainjar.com/

Most of the code and the concepts of the current version have, not
surprisingly, been created by Morten Wang.

The code needed to add the ability to control expansion as well as separate
icons for closed & open state of sub menus was provided by Arthur Veinstein.

The patch needed to make tracking work when navigating local files in
Microsoft Internet Explorer was provided by both Bill Lange
and David Favis-Mortlock.
